## Notes
1. **Version 3.15.0 (131)** is the latest version **"06/Aug/2025"**.
2. The game updates around every **Wednesday at (09:00 AM UTC)**.
3. **"G"** is for Google Play versions, **"T"** is for TapTap versions, and **NA** for versions that **don't** work (APK is available but missing OBB or it doesn't install or launch).
4. Google Play versions **(G)** and TapTap versions **(T)** are **not compatible** with each other due to differences in their digital signatures.

	• Google Play versions are signed by **Google**.
	
	• TapTap versions are signed by **Pigeon Games**.
	
	This means you cannot:

	• Install a **Google Play** version and update it to a **TapTap** version.

	• Install a **TapTap** version and update it to a **Google Play** version.

5. **Unavailable version codes (They don't exist): (13, 40, 67, 75, 76, 107, 114, 117)**.
