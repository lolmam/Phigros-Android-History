# How to Install

1. Download the APK, OBB and patch OBB files from the [Phigros Android History Website](https://phigros.lolmam.top) (TapTap versions don't need OBB).

2. Install the APK on your Android device.

	- If blocked, enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in settings.

3. Place the OBB and patch OBB files in the following folder:

	- `Internal Storage/Android/obb/com.PigeonGames.Phigros/`

    - If the folder doesn't exist, create it manually.

4. Make sure the OBB filename matches the **Version Code**:
    - `main.X.com.PigeonGames.Phigros.obb` (Where the X is the version code)
	- `patch.X.com.PigeonGames.Phigros.obb` (Same for patch OBB)
	- Example: `main.12.com.PigeonGames.Phigros.obb` For Phigros Version `1.3.0` and Version Code `12`

5. Launch the game and enjoy.
